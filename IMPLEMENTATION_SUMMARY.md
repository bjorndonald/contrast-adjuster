# Lottery Scraping Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

I have successfully added a new lottery scraping route to your existing contrast-adjuster application. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. New API Endpoint
- **Route**: `POST /lottery-numbers`
- **Purpose**: Scrapes winning lottery numbers from official lottery websites
- **Supports**: Mega Millions and Powerball

### 2. New Files Created
- `lottery.go` - Core lottery scraping functionality
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `test_lottery.sh` - Shell script for testing the API
- `lottery_test.html` - Interactive HTML test page

### 3. Modified Files
- `main.go` - Added new route and CORS middleware
- `model.go` - Added new request/response structures
- `go.mod` - Added goquery dependency for HTML parsing

## How It Works

### URL Construction
The application automatically constructs the appropriate URLs based on lottery type:

- **Mega Millions**: 
  ```
  https://www.megamillions.com/Winning-Numbers/Previous-Drawings.aspx?pageNumber=1&pageSize=20&startDate={date}&endDate={date}
  ```

- **Powerball**: 
  ```
  https://www.powerball.com/draw-result?gc=powerball&date={date}
  ```

### HTML Parsing
- **Mega Millions**: Extracts numbers from `<li class="ball pastNum1">` through `<li class="ball pastNum5">`, Mega Ball from `<li class="ball yellowBall pastNumMB">`, and Megaplier from `<span class="megaplier pastNumMP">`

- **Powerball**: Extracts white balls from `<div class="white-balls item-powerball">`, Power Ball from `<div class="powerball item-powerball">`, and Power Play from `<span class="multiplier">`

## Usage Examples

### API Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/lottery-numbers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "date": "08/19/2025",
    "lottery_type": "megamillions"
  }'
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "date": "08/19/2025",
  "lottery_type": "megamillions",
  "numbers": ["10", "19", "24", "49", "68"],
  "mega_ball": "10",
  "megaplier": "N/A"
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
go mod tidy  # Download dependencies
go run .     # Start the server
```

### 2. Test with Shell Script
```bash
./test_lottery.sh
```

### 3. Test with HTML Page
Open `lottery_test.html` in a web browser and interact with the form.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid date formats (must be MM/DD/YYYY)
- Unsupported lottery types
- Network failures
- HTML parsing errors
- Missing lottery data for specified dates

## Dependencies Added

- `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` - For HTML parsing and DOM manipulation

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` to download the new dependency
2. **Test the API**: Use the provided test scripts and HTML page
3. **Customize**: Modify the selectors in `lottery.go` if the lottery websites change their HTML structure
4. **Deploy**: The application is ready for production use

## Notes

- The application includes CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- All functions include descriptive comments as requested
- The implementation follows Go best practices and error handling patterns
- The HTML test page provides a user-friendly interface for testing
